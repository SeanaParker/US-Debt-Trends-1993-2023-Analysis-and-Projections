## Project Background

Managing public debt is essential to a nation's financial stability and long-term economic growth. Iâ€™m working with a **small debt agency in Washington, DC**, that specializes in **analyzing and forecasting public and private debt**. Our team has been asked by the **U.S. Government** to conduct a **comprehensive review of public debt from 1993 to 2023**, focusing on **annual debt growth, seasonal borrowing trends, and future projections**.

### This analysis aims to answer:
- **How much has debt increased each year compared to the previous year?**
- **Which months historically see the highest and lowest increases in total debt?**
- **What is the projected growth of publicly held debt in the next few years?**

To conduct this analysis, I used **Excel** to clean and structure the data, create **pivot tables for trend analysis**, and summarize key findings in a **final output sheet with insights and visualizations**.

## Data Structure & Initial Checks

The dataset consists of three primary components:

- **Debt Held by the Public**: The portion of the US public debt held by individuals, corporations, foreign governments, and entities outside of the US government.
- **Intergovernmental Holdings**: The portion of the US public debt held by various US government agencies.
- **Total Public Debt Outstanding**: The sum of the debt held by the public and intergovernmental holdings.

### **Data Cleaning Steps:**
- Removed duplicate entries based on `Record Date`.
- Transposed data for better structuring and analysis.
- Properly formatted financial data for accounting consistency.

## Executive Summary

Total public debt has steadily increased, growing at an **average annual rate of 5% from 2016 to 2019**, before surging **by over 20% in 2020** due to the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Since then, debt growth has returned to **pre-pandemic levels**, following a **more stable trajectory**.

- **Historical patterns show** that the highest increases in debt typically occur in **January, February, November, and December**, while the lowest growth rates are observed between **April and July**.
- **Projections suggest** that total public debt will reach approximately **$33 trillion by 2027**, growing at an estimated annual rate of **6.1%**.
- However, factors such as **inflation, fiscal policy, and broader market conditions** may influence future debt trends, highlighting the need for **continued monitoring and strategic financial planning**.

## Insights Deep Dive

### **Annual Percentage Increase in Debt**
- From **2016 to 2019**, total public debt grew by an average of **5.13% per year**.
  - **Debt Held by the Public** increased at **5.63% annually**.
  - **Intergovernmental Holdings** grew at a slower rate of **3.82%**.
  - This suggests **external borrowing** was the primary driver of debt growth.

- In **2020**, total public debt surged by **19.6%**, primarily due to:
  - **A 25.99% jump in Debt Held by the Public**.
  - **Intergovernmental Holdings increased only 1.40%**.
  - This rapid increase was a **direct response to the COVID-19 pandemic**, with stimulus spending and emergency funding driving borrowing.

- While **debt growth slowed post-2020**, it remains **above pre-pandemic levels**, averaging **6.42% annually** compared to **5.13% pre-pandemic**.

---

### **Monthly Debt Increase Trends**
- Debt tends to **increase the most** in **January, November, and December**, likely due to:
  - **Increased federal spending**.
  - **Higher consumer activity during the holiday season**.

- **April through July** tend to see **the lowest increases** in debt, which may be attributed to:
  - **Tax revenues reducing borrowing needs**.
  - **Fewer major spending events**.

- These trends suggest that **debt accumulation follows predictable fiscal cycles** rather than occurring randomly.

---

### **Projected Debt Growth**
- Public debt has **grown significantly over the past two decades**, rising from **$6 trillion in 2008** to **$25 trillion in 2022**.
- If borrowing continues at this pace, **public debt is expected to reach $33 trillion by 2027**.
- While growth is expected to slow, **overall debt levels remain on an upward trajectory**.

ðŸ“ˆ Future debt growth is **projected to stabilize between 5-7% per year**, but **inflation, interest rate changes, and policy shifts** could impact this outlook. **Close monitoring** of these variables will be crucial in shaping future trends.

---

## Recommendations

Based on the findings, I recommend the following actions:

1. **Develop a long-term debt strategy** to manage borrowing and reduce financial risks.
2. **Adjust budget planning for seasonal debt fluctuations** to allocate resources efficiently throughout the year.
3. **Track key economic indicators** (e.g., inflation, unemployment, GDP) to anticipate potential impacts on debt levels.
4. **Improve debt forecasting models** by incorporating broader macroeconomic factors for more accurate projections.

## Assumptions and Caveats

Throughout the analysis, a few assumptions and caveats were noted:

- **Debt Reporting Frequency**  
  - *Debt Held by the Public* and *Total Public Debt Outstanding* were initially **reported annually from 1997 to 2001**, then **shifted to monthly reporting from 2002 to 2005**, before transitioning to **more frequent, often daily, reporting**.  
  - These changes in reporting **may impact trend analysis, particularly in earlier years**.

- **Projection Limitations**  
  - Future debt projections assume **no major economic disruptions** (e.g., financial crises, significant policy changes) **beyond 2023**. Unexpected events could **alter these forecasts**.
